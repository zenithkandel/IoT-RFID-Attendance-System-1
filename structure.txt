                        PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

EDU TRACK PRO is a production-ready IoT-based smart attendance management 
system that uses RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology to automate
the process of tracking student attendance. The system eliminates manual
attendance marking, reduces errors, and provides real-time data analytics.
